 -South facing, decreases y coordinate
 -West facing, decreases x coordinate
 -Multiple robots, only active robots change

Turn left
 -North facing, changes to West
 -East facing, changes to North
 -South facing, changes to East
 -West facing, changes to South
 -Multiple robots, only active robots change

 Turn Right
 -North facing, changes to East
 -East facing, changes to South
 -South facing, changes to West
 -West facing, changes to North
 -Multiple robots, only active robots change

PLACE 
- Can place one robot, automatically set as active
- Can place multiple robots, only first one is active
- Can place robot North facing
- Can place robot East facing

Active
 Can set other robot as active, old robot ceases to be active 
 New active robot only responds to subsequent commands
